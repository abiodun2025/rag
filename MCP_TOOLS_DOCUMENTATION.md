## 🧠 Smart Agent Intent Detection

The Smart Agent analyzes user messages and routes them to appropriate tools:

### Intent Categories:
- **email** (90% confidence) - Email-related requests
- **mcp_tools** (80% confidence) - MCP tool requests
- **search** (80% confidence) - Search requests
- **general** - General conversation

### Example Intent Detection:
```
"send email to test@example.com" → email intent → sendmail_simple tool
"count r letters in programming" → mcp_tools intent → count_r tool
"list desktop files" → mcp_tools intent → list_desktop_contents tool
```
