# GitHub Coverage Agent Testing Framework

## 🎯 Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive testing framework for the **GitHub Coverage Agent** that analyzes test coverage of pull requests and provides intelligent suggestions for missing test cases.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Running Tests on GitHub

The tests are automatically run on GitHub Actions when you push to the `feature/test_coverage_suggestions_agent` branch or create a pull request.

**View the latest test results:**
- Go to the [Actions tab](https://github.com/abiodun2025/rag/actions) in this repository
- Click on the latest "Test Coverage Agent" workflow run
- Review the test results and any generated reports

### Running Tests Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abiodun2025/rag.git
cd rag
git checkout feature/test_coverage_suggestions_agent
```

2. **Set up environment variables:**
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_personal_access_token"
export GITHUB_OWNER="abiodun2025"
export GITHUB_REPO="rag"
```

3. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install requests coverage pytest
```

4. **Run the tests:**
```bash
# Run all tests
python3 test_real_world_agent.py

# Run specific test categories
python3 simple_coverage_test.py
python3 working_coverage_demo.py
python3 comprehensive_github_coverage_test.py
```

## 🔧 GitHub Actions Workflow

The `.github/workflows/test-coverage-agent.yml` file defines the automated testing workflow that runs:

1. **Simple Coverage Test** - Basic coverage verification
2. **Working Coverage Demo** - Code generation demonstration
3. **Comprehensive GitHub Test** - Full GitHub integration testing
4. **Real-World Agent Test** - Complete test suite execution
5. **Agent Initialization Test** - Agent setup validation
6. **Language Detection Test** - Language identification verification
7. **GitHub API Connection Test** - API connectivity validation

## 🎯 Supported Languages & Tools

- **Java/Kotlin**: JaCoCo XML reports
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Istanbul JSON reports
- **Python**: Coverage.py reports
- **Go**: Go test coverage reports

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_token"
   export GITHUB_OWNER="your_username"
   export GITHUB_REPO="your_repository"
   ```

2. **GitHub API Rate Limiting**
   - The tests automatically check rate limits
   - Wait for rate limit reset if needed

3. **Repository Access Denied**
   - Verify token has `repo` scope
   - Check repository permissions

4. **Coverage Tool Not Found**
   ```bash
   pip install coverage
   ```

### Debug Mode

Run tests with verbose output:
```bash
python3 test_real_world_agent.py --verbose
```
