# GitHub Coverage Agent Testing Summary

## 🎯 How to Test the Agent with Real-World Guidelines

This document provides a comprehensive guide on how to test the **GitHub Coverage Agent** responsible for analyzing test coverage of pull requests and providing intelligent suggestions for missing test cases.

## 🏗️ Agent Architecture Overview

### Core Components
1. **TestCoverageAgent** - Base agent for coverage analysis
2. **GitHubCoverageAgent** - GitHub-integrated version with repository access
3. **CoverageData** - Data structure for coverage information
4. **TestSuggestion** - Data structure for test suggestions

### Supported Languages & Tools
- **Java/Kotlin**: JaCoCo XML reports
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Istanbul JSON reports  
- **Python**: Coverage.py reports
- **Go**: Go test coverage reports

## 🚀 Prerequisites Setup

### Environment Configuration
```bash
# Install required packages
pip install requests coverage pytest

# Set up GitHub credentials
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_personal_access_token"
export GITHUB_OWNER="your_username_or_organization"
export GITHUB_REPO="your_repository_name"

# Optional: LLM API for enhanced suggestions
export LLM_API_KEY="your_llm_api_key"
```

### GitHub Token Setup
1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Generate a new token with `repo` scope
3. Copy the token and set it as `GITHUB_TOKEN`

## 🧪 Testing Methods

### 2. Individual Component Testing

#### Test Agent Initialization
```python
from agent.test_coverage_agent import TestCoverageAgent
from agent.github_coverage_agent import GitHubCoverageAgent, GitHubConfig

# Test base agent
base_agent = TestCoverageAgent()
assert 'java' in base_agent.supported_languages
assert 'py' in base_agent.supported_languages

# Test GitHub agent
config = GitHubConfig(token="your_token", owner="your_owner", repo="your_repo")
github_agent = GitHubCoverageAgent(config)
```

#### Test Language Detection
```python
agent = TestCoverageAgent()
test_cases = [
    ('src/main.java', 'java'),
    ('app/User.kt', 'kt'),
    ('components/Button.js', 'js'),
    ('utils/helper.ts', 'ts'),
    ('main.py', 'py'),
    ('server.go', 'go')
]

for file_path, expected_language in test_cases:
    detected = agent._detect_language(file_path)
    assert detected == expected_language
```

#### Test GitHub API Connection
```python
import requests

headers = {
    "Authorization": f"token {os.getenv('GITHUB_TOKEN')}",
    "Accept": "application/vnd.github.v3+json"
}

repo_url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}"
response = requests.get(repo_url, headers=headers)
assert response.status_code == 200
```

rate_limit_url = "https://api.github.com/rate_limit"
response = requests.get(rate_limit_url, headers=headers)
rate_data = response.json()
remaining = rate_data['resources']['core']['remaining']
```

**Solution**: Verify token permissions and repository access
```python
# Test repository access
repo_url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}"
response = requests.get(repo_url, headers=headers)
if response.status_code == 404:
    print("Repository not found or access denied")
```
