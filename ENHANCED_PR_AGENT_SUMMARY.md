# Enhanced PR Agent with Intelligent Validation

## 🎯 Overview

The PR agent has been enhanced with intelligent validation to automatically check if branches have new commits before creating pull requests. This prevents the common GitHub validation errors and provides helpful feedback to users.

## ✨ New Features

### 1. **Automatic Commit Validation**
- **Before PR Creation**: Automatically checks if source branch has new commits compared to target branch
- **Prevents Errors**: Stops "No commits between branches" GitHub validation errors
- **Smart Detection**: Uses GitHub API to compare branch commits and count differences

### 2. **Existing PR Detection**
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Checks if a PR already exists for the branch combination
- **Helpful Suggestions**: Provides links to existing PRs instead of creating duplicates
- **Smart Workflow**: Prevents unnecessary API calls and provides better user experience

### 3. **Enhanced Error Messages**
- **Detailed Feedback**: Provides specific reasons why PR creation failed
- **Actionable Suggestions**: Gives users clear next steps to resolve issues
- **Validation Details**: Shows commit counts, branch status, and comparison results

### 4. **New Tools Available**

#### `check_branch_commits`
- **Purpose**: Check if a branch has new commits compared to another branch
- **Usage**: `check_branch_commits` with `source_branch` and `target_branch` parameters
- **Returns**: Detailed commit comparison including ahead/behind counts

#### Enhanced `create_pull_request`
- **Purpose**: Create pull requests with intelligent validation
- **Features**: 
  - Automatic commit validation
  - Existing PR detection
  - Detailed error messages with suggestions
  - Validation details in response

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### New Methods Added

1. **`_check_branch_has_new_commits(source_branch, target_branch)`**
   - Compares branch commits using GitHub API
   - Returns detailed comparison information
   - Handles edge cases and errors gracefully

2. **`_check_existing_pull_request(source_branch, target_branch)`**
   - Searches for existing PRs with same branch combination
   - Returns PR details if found
   - Prevents duplicate PR creation

3. **`_check_branch_commits_tool(arguments)`**
   - Standalone tool for checking branch commits
   - Available via MCP bridge API
   - Used by CLI and other tools

### Enhanced Workflow

```
1. User requests PR creation
   ↓
2. Check if source branch has new commits
   ↓
3. If no new commits → Return error with suggestion
   ↓
4. Check if PR already exists
   ↓
5. If PR exists → Return error with existing PR link
   ↓
6. Create pull request
   ↓
7. Return success with validation details
```

## 📋 CLI Commands

### New Commands Available

#### `branches`
Lists all available branches with protection status and commit information.

#### `check-commits <branch_name>`
Checks if a specific branch has new commits compared to main.

**Example:**
```bash
check-commits feature/my-feature
```

**Output:**
```
🔍 Checking commits for branch: feature/my-feature
📊 Branch: feature/my-feature
   Status: ✅ Has new commits
   Details: Source branch is 3 commits ahead, 0 commits behind
   📈 Ahead by: 3 commits
   📉 Behind by: 0 commits
   📊 Total commits: 3
   💡 This branch is ready for PR creation!
   🔗 Source SHA: a1b2c3d4
   🔗 Target SHA: e5f6g7h8
```

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Test Scenarios

1. **Branch with No New Commits**
   ```
   ✅ Correctly rejected: No new commits found in feature/login compared to main
   💡 Suggestion: Make commits to feature/login before creating a pull request
   ```

2. **Branch with Existing PR**
   ```
   ✅ Correctly rejected: A pull request already exists for feature/agent_code_review → main
   🔗 Existing PR: #7 - https://github.com/abiodun2025/rag/pull/7
   💡 Suggestion: Use existing PR #7: https://github.com/abiodun2025/rag/pull/7
   ```

3. **Valid Branch for PR Creation**
   ```
   ✅ Branch has new commits: True
   📊 Details: Source branch is 12 commits ahead, 1 commits behind
   ```
